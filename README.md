Fair, collaborative music queues for dance socials.

Guests join an event from a QR code, add songs from a link or by title, and a fair scheduler decides the order:
a per-person song limit, no back-to-back songs from one person, and caps on how long one style can run. The
organiser controls the night; one device plays the music from local files (or in manual mode). No accounts.

## A CSR initiative

Qroove is a corporate social responsibility initiative of [Sataklela OÜ](https://sataklela.com), built for
community dance socials and free to use. It is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only so improvements stay open for
everyone. Piloted with the LSU Salsa Society (pilot community; not an endorsement). Qroove never streams or
hosts music: you play only what you are licensed to play.
