# Player guide

The organiser's device plays the music. There is no separate player page: the organiser page takes the player role by
itself, and a second device with organiser access takes over from the first. After a handover, the new organiser's device
becomes the player.

## Starting

Press **Start playing** at the top of the organiser page. Browsers need one tap before they play sound; after that, songs
start by themselves. **Keep the page open**, because the music stops if you leave it.

Under **More** you will find an optional test chime and **Sound check and audio files**, where you can pick files or a
folder. They are read in the browser and **never uploaded**.

Each requested song is matched to a file by the same artist/title/version fingerprint the server uses for
duplicates, so `Marc Anthony - Vivir Mi Vida.mp3` matches a request for "Vivir Mi Vida (feat. X)" by Marc
Anthony. Embedded tags are read first, with the file name (`Artist - Title`) as the fallback. If either side
has no artist the match is shown as _probable (title only)_. A "Live" or "Remix" version never matches the
studio request. You can also pick a file for a single song by hand.

## Playing

- The song reserved next is shown with its match status. Press **Start** once: the first tap unlocks audio
  on phones and tablets. After that, the next reserved songs start by themselves.
- A song counts as played only when audio actually begins (the browser's `playing` event) and is finished
  when the file ends. A file that fails to play after starting is recorded as skipped; before starting, the
  card falls back to manual mode.
- **Manual mode** (no matching file): open the requester's link, play it however you are allowed to, then
  press **Mark started** and, when it finishes, **Mark ended**. A manually started song counts for fairness
  and duplicates like any other. Qroove never marks a song ended because a timer ran out, and it cannot
  promise ad-free playback for a link.
- The lock screen and Bluetooth headset buttons can play and pause, and the screen is kept awake while a
  song plays where the browser allows it.

## Lease and handover

The player holds a lease that it renews every 10 seconds. If another device claims it, this one stops
immediately and says _Another device took over playback_. A song cannot be handed over mid-track, because
the file may exist only on the old device; the new device starts at the next song once its owner has
checked it has the music. Reloading the page keeps the lease for the browser tab.

## Tips

- **Bluetooth:** connect and choose the output in the device's own settings before the sound check; the
  browser cannot choose or fix the route. Disable sleep and keep the device charging.
- **iPhone and iPad:** audio only starts after a tap, and playback can be suspended if the screen locks or
  the tab is in the background. A laptop with local files is more reliable than a phone.
- **Remember on this device** copies the files into the browser's private storage so you need not choose
  them again. Only use it if the music owner allows copies, and untick it to delete them. Browsers may
  remove stored files at any time; just choose them again.

## Rights

Only play recordings you are licensed to play at the venue. Public performance may need licences beyond
owning the file or having a streaming subscription; check with the society or venue before using Qroove at
a live event.
